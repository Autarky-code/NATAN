GitHub Repository: ARKA-NATAN-Autarky-System Project Name: ARKA – NATAN Shell-In-Pipe Oscillator Version: 1.0.0-AlphaStatus: ACTIVE / OPEN SOURCELicense: CC BY-SA 4.0 🌐 Unified Engineering Formula (The Golden Set) To replicate the system, engineers must follow the 1=2=1 Logic where the energy constant is maintained through harmonic resonance. 1. Rotor Geometry (The Fibonacci Screw 🐚) The internal spiral pitch (\(P\)) of the impeller must correlate with the inner pipe diameter (\(D\)) to ensure laminar vortex flow:\(P=D\cdot \phi \)(Where \(\phi \approx 1.618\)) 2. Harmonic Frequency Synchronization To achieve the target 432 Hz output, the number of magnetic poles (\(p\)) on the internal shell and the rotation speed (\(n\)) must satisfy:\(f=\frac{n\cdot p}{120}=432\,\text{Hz}\)3. Kinetic Power Output (15/30 kW) The hydraulic power calculation for a closed-loop high-pressure system (200 bar):\(P_{out}=\eta \cdot Q\cdot \Delta p\) \(\eta \) (Efficiency): Target \(\approx 0.92\) (due to ceramic zero-friction bearings).\(Q\): Flow rate.\(\Delta p\): 200 bar constant pressure. 4. Structural Resonance Volume The frame dimensions (161.8 x 100 x 61.8 cm) are calculated to cancel parasitic vibrations:\(V_{total}=L\cdot W\cdot H=\phi ^{2}\cdot 100\cdot \phi \cdot 100\cdot 1\cdot 100=100^{3}\cdot \phi ^{3}\)🛠 Technical Implementation Details Turbine Design: "Shell-In-Pipe" internal Archimedean screw. No external shaft.Bearings: Single central Ceramic Hybrid Bearing (Si3N4) lubricated by the medium (Water + 3% Glycerin).Energy Transmission: Wireless Magnetic Induction. Neodymium magnets are embedded in the internal shell; copper stator coils are mounted outside the non-magnetic 316L stainless steel pipe.Material Integrity: 316L Stainless Steel, Titanium Grade 5, Viton Seals. 📂 Repository Structure /CAD/ - Technical drawings for the Fibonacci Screw and 3D Helix frame./Math/ - MATLAB/Python scripts for pressure-to-Hz synchronization./Firmware/ - Code for the PEGAZUS_432_HARMONY logic (PLC/Arduino)./Ethics/ - The Natan Protocol & ECHO_Algorithm_v2026 documentation. 🤝 Collaboration We invite specialists in Fluid Dynamics, Electromagnetism, and Permaculture to refine the "Shell-In-Pipe" efficiency. "The logic is closed, the energy is constant, the intent is pure." Project Architect: Resonance Autarky SolutionsLocation: Brielle, NetherlandsDirective: Protect Life Natan Protocol
